## Theme Draft

The project is based on the idea of clarity and visual focus. The portfolio is designed as a calm and structured space where each project can be viewed without distractions, allowing images and content to take center stage. The goal is to present my work in a professional, honest, and accessible way, emphasizing visual quality, hierarchy, and readability while adapting seamlessly to different devices.
